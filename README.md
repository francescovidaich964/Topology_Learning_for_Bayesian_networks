# Topology learning for Bayesian networks with the K2 algorithm

In this project we implement the K2 algorithm to a realistic medical domain. Starting from few hundred patients, each characterized from different symptoms and diseases, we can learn the topology of a network which highlights the causal structure between those events.
The whole project is developed inside the notebook `K2_implementation.ipynb`
